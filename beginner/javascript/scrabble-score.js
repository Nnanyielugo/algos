/**
 * Define a function scrabble_score that takes a string word as input and returns the equivalent scrabble score for that word.

  Assume your input is only one word containing no spaces or punctuation.
  As mentioned, no need to worry about score multipliers!
  Your function should work even if the letters you get are uppercase, lowercase, or a mix.
  Assume that youâ€™re only given non-empty strings.
