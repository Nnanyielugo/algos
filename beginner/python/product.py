"""
  Define a function called product that takes a list of integers as input and returns the product of all of the elements in the list. 
  For example: product([4, 5, 5]) should return 100 (because 4 * 5 * 5 is 100).

  Donâ€™t worry about the list being empty.
  Your function should return an integer.
