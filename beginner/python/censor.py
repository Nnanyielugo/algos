"""
  Write a function called censor that takes two strings, text and word, as input. 
  It should return the text with the word you chose replaced with asterisks. For example:

  censor("this hack is wack hack", "hack") ```

  should return: 

  ```py
  "this **** is wack ****"
  Assume your input strings wonâ€™t contain punctuation or upper case letters.
  The number of asterisks you put should correspond to the number of letters in the censored word.
